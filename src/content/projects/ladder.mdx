  ## About Ladder

  Browser tabs have become our primary interface with information, but managing them remains a challenge. Ladder is a Chrome extension that reimagines tab management through spatial organization and context preservation.

  <div className="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-8 my-8">
    <div>
      ### Core Features
      
      - **Spatial Organization**: Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for arranging tabs within and between windows
      - **Window Groups**: Preserve context by managing related tabs together
      - **Smart Archiving**: Save and restore entire windows or individual tabs with their metadata
      - **Resource Management**: "Discard" tabs to free up memory while maintaining quick access
      - **Full-Text Search**: Quickly find tabs across both active and archived states
    </div>

    <div className="bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-800 rounded-lg p-6">
      ### Technical Highlights

      - Built with Svelte for performant reactivity
      - Chrome Extensions API for deep browser integration
      - TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
      - Virtual scrolling for handling large numbers of tabs
      - Efficient local storage for archiving functionality
    </div>
  </div>

 
  ## Design Philosophy

  Ladder's design is guided by three core principles:

  <div className="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4 my-8">
    <div className="p-4 bg-purple-50 dark:bg-purple-900/20 rounded-lg">
      <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Spatial Intuition</h4>
      <p className="text-sm">Organization should feel as natural as arranging items on a desk</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="p-4 bg-blue-50 dark:bg-blue-900/20 rounded-lg">
      <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Context Preservation</h4>
      <p className="text-sm">Windows as workspaces, maintaining task and project context</p>
    </div>
    
    <div className="p-4 bg-cyan-50 dark:bg-cyan-900/20 rounded-lg">
      <h4 className="font-semibold mb-2">Lightweight Persistence</h4>
      <p className="text-sm">Archive and restore with minimal cognitive overhead</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  ## Future Development

  The next phase of Ladder's development will focus on:

  - Cross-device synchronization capabilities
  - Enhanced tab relationship visualization
  - Integration with popular productivity tools
  - Performance optimizations for very large tab sets
  - Customizable keyboard shortcuts and gestures

  ## Learning Outcomes

  Building Ladder provided valuable experience in:
  - Chrome Extension development and its constraints
  - Complex state management in Svelte
  - Building intuitive drag-and-drop interfaces
  - Optimizing performance for large datasets
  - Designing for user privacy and data persistence
