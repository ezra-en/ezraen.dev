## About DynDeck

DynDeck is revolutionizing presentation software by combining the power of dynamic content with the reliability of local-first design. Built for modern presenters who need flexibility, reliability, and powerful features without compromising on simplicity.

### Vision

DynDeck emerged from a simple observation: existing presentation tools haven't kept pace with how we actually create and deliver content in today's multi-display, multi-language, collaboration-heavy world. We're building a platform that brings presentation software into the modern era, with features that speakers, churches, educators, and professionals actually need.
